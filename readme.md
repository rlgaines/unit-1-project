# Robby Gaines's Front-End Project Proposal

## Not So Fifa Soccer
My prodject will be a game that is similiar to the user experience of Pong. It will be a two player game that only allows the user to move vertically while the ball will bouncing off everything except for the goal. It will keep track of points and the game will end after a certain amount of goals.

## Technologies Involved
I will be using HTML, CSS, Canvas, JS to create the funcitonality of the game. Also bringing images that will respond with the code. The JS will control the speed of the ball and movement of the players. This way the game can change speeds by the response of each player. 


## Stretch

The stretch goal will be to make it alot more attractive with graphics and funcitons. Instead of only two player mode it could have option to choose 2 player or verse the Computer.
